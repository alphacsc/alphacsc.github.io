=====================================================================
Extracting artifact and evoked response atoms from the sample dataset
=====================================================================

This example illustrates how to learn rank-1 [1]_ atoms on the multivariate
sample dataset from :code:`mne`. We display a selection of atoms, featuring
heartbeat and eyeblink artifacts, two atoms of evoked responses, and a
non-sinusoidal oscillation.

Let us first define the parameters of our model.

    # sampling frequency. The signal will be resampled to match this.
    sfreq = 150.

    # Define the shape of the dictionary
    n_atoms = 40
    n_times_atom = int(round(sfreq * 1.0))  # 1000. ms

    # Regularization parameter which control sparsity
    reg = 0.1

    # number of processors for parallel computing
    n_jobs = 5

    # To accelerate the run time of this example, we split the signal in n_slits.
    # The number of splits should actually be the smallest possible to avoid
    # introducing border artifacts in the learned atoms and it should be not much
    # larger than n_jobs.
    n_splits = 10

Load the sample data from MNE-python and select the gradiometer channels.
The MNE sample data contains MEG recordings of a subject with visual and
auditory stimuli. We load the data using utilities from MNE-python as a Raw
object and select the gradiometers from the signal.

drift which can impact the CSC technique. The signal is also resampled to

Load the data as an array and split it in chunks to allow parallel processing
during the model fit. Each split is considered as independent.
To reduce the impact of border artifacts, we use `apply_window=True`
which scales down the border of each split with a tukey window.

Display the evoked reconstructed envelope
-----------------------------------------

The MNE sample data contains data for auditory (event_id=1 and 2) and
visual stimuli (event_id=3 and 4). We extract the events now so that we can
later identify the atoms related to different events. Note that the
convolutional sparse coding method does not need to know the events for
learning atoms.

For each atom (columns), and for each event (rows), we compute the envelope
of the reconstructed signal, align it with respect to the event onsets, and
take the average. For some atoms, the activations are correlated with the
events, leading to a large evoked envelope. The gray area corresponds to
not statistically significant values, computing with sampling.

Display the equivalent dipole for a learned topomap
---------------------------------------------------

Finally, let us fit a dipole to one of the atoms. To fit a dipole,
we need the following:

* BEM solution: Obtained by running the cortical reconstruction pipeline
  of Freesurfer and describes the conductivity of different tissues in
  the head.
* Trans: An affine transformation matrix needed to bring the data
  from sensor space to head space. This is usually done by coregistering
  the fiducials with the MRI.
* Noise covariance matrix: To whiten the data so that the assumption
  of Gaussian noise model with identity covariance matrix is satisfied.

We recommend users to consult the MNE documentation for further information.
